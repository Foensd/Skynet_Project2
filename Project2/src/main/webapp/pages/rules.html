		<div id="Hacker" class="tabcontent">
			<h3>Hacker</h3>
			<p>Hackers want to take over the town.</p>
			<p>At night Hackers will choose someone to fire. That person has
				to leave Revature town first thing in the morning.</p>
			<p>Hackers win the game if there's less people in Revature Town
				then there are Hackers. Every game starts with at least 1 Hacker.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="Trainer" class="tabcontent">
			<h3>Trainer</h3>
			<p>The Trainer is the good guy.</p>
			<p>At night the Trainer will investigate one of the employees and
				make sure that person is not a Hacker.</p>
			<p>If that person is indeed a Hacker, the Trainer will fire that
				person.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="HR" class="tabcontent">
			<h3>HR</h3>
			<p>HR has an important role.</p>
			<p>At night, HR can vouch for somebody that would have been
				fired, and keep that person in Revature Town.</p>
			<p>However, HR can step in for ANYONE that would have been fired
				- regardless of that person's role (Employee, Trainer, or even a
				Hacker).</p>
			<p>If HR wants, they can decide to vouch for themselves at night
				instead of a random person.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="Employee" class="tabcontent">
			<h3>Employee</h3>
			<p>Employees make up the majority of Revature Town.</p>
			<p>Employees come to work everyday, enjoy a cup of coffee, and go
				home after hours of programming.</p>
			<p>At night, employees simply go to sleep, since they have to
				wake up early next morning.</p>
			<p>During the day however, employees can come together to
				investigate and figure out who the Hacker possibly could be.</p>
